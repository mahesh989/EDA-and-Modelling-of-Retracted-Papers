,Regenerative medicine,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Microfragmented adipose tissue in the treatment of a full-thickness supraspinatus tear: a case report.,"A 70-year-old female presented with an 8-month history of right anterior shoulder pain and weakness, unresolved with conservative management. Among other shoulder pathology, the patient was diagnosed with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear and elected to proceed with the microfragmented adipose tissue procedure to treat the injured tendon and nearby relevant structures. Improvements in pain and function were documented along with progressive healing of the supraspinatus on ultrasound and MRI following the procedure. This case demonstrates the efficacy of microfragmented adipose tissue as a relatively novel approach to treating non-retracted, full-thickness rotator cuff tears.","Ferrell, John L; Dodson, Alanna; Martin, Joshua","{'Year': '2023', 'Month': 'Oct'}"
,Research in veterinary science,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Teratogenic effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation on the embryonic development of chick: A study on morphology and hatchability.,"The present study was aimed at studying the effects of RF-EMR in causing teratogenic changes in the embryonic development of organisms using chick embryo as a model. The fertilized eggs of the hen were incubated in a digital humidified incubator and exposed to RF-EMR from 2G and 4G mobile phones by ringing at regular time intervals. The dose of RF-EMR was varied by increasing the call duration and number of calls per day, with the lower dose being a call duration of 50 min/day and the higher dose being 90 min/day. The phone kept had a range of radiofrequency between 900 and 1800 MHz and SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) 1.355 (2G) and 1.12 (4G) watts/ kg respectively. The batch of eggs incubated without any exposure to RF-EMR was taken as control. The hatchability of 2G and 4G experimental groups were respectively, 65% and 75% at lower radiation exposure and 40% and 55% at higher radiation exposure. The teratogenic effects of RF-EMR on the morphology of chick embryos manifested as the cross beak, non-retracted yolk sac, macrocephaly, malformed legs and toes, disability in standing and balancing the body and variations in body weight, body length and beak length. The results indicate that the RF-EMR poses potential threats to the developing stages of organisms.","Augustianath, Tessy; Evans, D A; Anisha, G S","{'Year': '2023', 'Month': 'Jun'}"

,PloS one,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Self-correction in science: The effect of retraction on the frequency of citations.,"We investigate the citation frequency of retracted scientific papers in science. For the period of five years before and after retraction, we counted the citations to papers in a sample of over 3,000 retracted, and a matched sample of another 3,000 non-retracted papers. Retraction led to a decrease in average annual citation frequency from about 5 before, to 2 citations after retraction. In contrast, for non-retracted control papers the citation counts were 4, and 5, respectively. Put differently, we found only a limited effect of retraction: retraction decreased citation frequency only by about 60%, as compared to non-retracted papers. Thus, retracted papers often live on. For effective self-correction the scientific enterprise needs to be more effective in removing retracted papers from the scientific record. We discuss recent proposals to do so.","Kühberger, Anton; Streit, Daniel; Scherndl, Thomas",{'Year': '2022'}

A retrospective, observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital including charts of patients spanning a duration of one year, where 15 patients diagnosed with chronic otitis media-mucosal disease with large and subtotal perforations (with or without ossicular erosion), and had undergone interlay cartilage rim augmented fascia tympanoplasty, were analysed for morphological and functional improvement following surgery. Pre- and post-operative otomicroscopic examination and pure tone audiometry findings were the parameters considered. 86.6% had a well-healed, non-retracted, undisplaced mobile neotympanum, 6.7% who underwent a type III (minor columella) tympanoplasty had a medialised neotympanum and 1 subject (6.7%) who underwent a type I tympanoplasty had a residual pinpoint perforation which healed with conservative management. The overall morphological success rate was 93.3%. The mean hearing gain following surgery was 20.84 dB with a minimum gain of 10 dB and a maximum gain of 30 dB. The mean air-bone gap closure gain achieved was 19.2 dB with a minimum gain of 6.4 dB and a maximum gain of 30 dB. The interlay cartilage-fascia rim augmentation tympanoplasty is a novel, effective graft model suggested for large and sub-total central perforations. Future randomized studies with a larger sample size could be performed with longer follow-up to assess the outcome of this technique.","Bhandarkar, Ajay M; Krishnan, Neethu V; Mathew, Neethu Mary","{'Year': '2022', 'Month': 'Mar'}"

Non-retracted and moderately retracted rotator cuff tears usually heal after repair, and muscle atrophy may recover over time. It follows that early rotator cuff repair is beneficial for many patients with chronic but reparable rotator cuff tears. Diagnostic ultrasound can provide quantitative information about the recovery of both muscle and tendon and represents a viable alternative to magnetic resonance imaging for evaluating healing after rotator cuff repair.","Hasan, Samer S","{'Year': '2021', 'Month': 'Oct'}"
,Indian journal of orthopaedics,,Case Reports,Non-Retracted,,Latissimus Dorsi Tear in an Olympics-Level Tennis Player: Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Latissimus dorsi tears are extremely rare and are encountered primarily in high-level athletes. Noted initially in baseball pitchers, cases have been described in other sports too, with one report of a latissimus dorsi tear at the muscle-tendon junction in a tennis player. Anecdotal outcomes have been comparative after both non-operative and operative treatments. Although no clear indications for operative intervention exist, there is a general consensus that partial non-retracted tears can be managed with non-operative treatment, whereas complete tears warrant surgical repair. This case report describes a complete rupture with retraction of the latissimus dorsi tendon that occurred during a competitive match in an international level tennis player. Due to compelling sports participation reasons, this tear was managed with non-operative treatment. The player returned to competitive tennis within 6 weeks and won the Asian Games men's doubles tennis gold medal 53 days following his injury. He has had no subsequent shoulder-related symptoms despite his continuous participation in international level tennis for the past 18 months. We analyse the role of the latissimus dorsi in tennis and also review the available literature on this uncommon sports injury.","Pardiwala, Dinshaw N; Subbiah, Kushalappa; Rao, Nandan; Modi, Rahul","{'Year': '2020', 'Month': 'May'}"

,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai kaiho,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,[Changes in the Physical Characteristics of the Eardrum Induced by Otitis Media with Effusion].,"Detecting changes in the physical characteristics of the eardrum by ocular inspection is difficult. Herein, we propose an alternative method for the quantitative detection of such changes using an acoustic conductance tympanogram, termed as G tympanograms, which exhibit the real part of acoustic admittance. 　The middle ear, including the eardrum, can be modeled using a mechano-acoustic system with physical parameters comprising mass, spring, and friction, and we have developed a procedure to numerically evaluate these parameters. We report the results obtained thus far and discuss their significance and implications. 　Specifically, we performed pure tone audiometry, 226-Hz tympanometry, and rigid endoscope otoscopy on 175 children aged 5-13 years. Of 350 total ears, we selected 248 ears with normal hearing levels, type A tympanogram, no effusion in the middle ear, non-retracted eardrums, and no eardrum calcification. We measured the distortion product of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) and performed four-frequency (i.e., 226, 678, 800 and 1000 Hz) tympanometry. From the latter analysis, we extracted G-tympanograms, which enabled us to calculate the above-mentioned parameters, the spring constant in particular, for each of the 248 selected ears. We classified these ears into three groups: group I (68 ears), which showed no evidence of acute otitis media (OMA) or otitis media with effusion (OME); group II (68 ears), which showed evidence of OMA but not of OME; and group III (112 ears), which showed evidence of OME and OMA. 　We found that ears in group III had reduced spring constants, even after apparently recovering from OME. We also found a strong correlation between the spring constant and OAE value, which suggests that eardrums with low OAE values tend to have reduced spring constants. Because DPOAE-measurement is much easier to perform than four-frequency tympanometry, we suggest that DPOAE is a practical means of detecting reduced spring constants.","Murakami, Rikio; Murakami, Mami; Tabuchi, Keisaku","{'Year': '2016', 'Month': 'Nov'}"

,Journal of medical ethics,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Misinformation in the medical literature: what role do error and fraud play?,"Media attention to retracted research suggests that a substantial number of papers are corrupted by misinformation. In reality, every paper contains misinformation; at issue is whether the balance of correct versus incorrect information is acceptable. This paper postulates that analysis of retracted research papers can provide insight into medical misinformation, although retracted papers are not a random sample of incorrect papers. Error is the most common reason for retraction and error may be the principal cause of misinformation as well. Still, one-quarter of retracted papers are fraudulent, and misinformation may also arise through fraud. This paper hypothesises that error and fraud are the main sources of misinformation and that error is more common than fraud. Retraction removes misinformation from the literature; bias is non-retracted misinformation. Bias arises when scientific impropriety results in false research findings. Impropriety can involve experimental design, data collection, data analysis, or data presentation. Yet impropriety also arises through earnest error or statistical naiveté; not all bias is fraud. Several measures are proposed to minimise misinformation in the medical literature, including: greater detail in the clinical trial registry, with rigorous definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria and primary endpoints; clear statistical criteria for every aspect of clinical trials, especially sample size; responsibility for data integrity that accrues to all named authors; increased transparency as to how the costs of research were paid; and greater clarity as to the reasons for retraction. Misinformation can arise without malicious intent; authors of incorrect papers are owed a presumption of incompetence, not malice.","Steen, R Grant","{'Year': '2011', 'Month': 'Aug'}"
,NMR in biomedicine,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,A comparison of the ADC and T2 mapping in an assessment of blood-clot lysability.,"The structural characteristics of blood clots are associated with their susceptibility to thrombolysis. As their morphology can be characterized by MRI, several attempts have been made to link the lysability of blood clots with their MRI properties; however, so far no study has associated a clot's lysability with the diffusion properties of the water in the clot. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is highly sensitive to changes in serum mobility and may be used to distinguish between the non-retracted and the fully retracted regions of the blood clot. Therefore, the ADC may be a suitable, or even a better, marker for an assessment of the clot's retraction and consequently for its lysability than the relaxation time T(2). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether it is possible to predict the outcome of clot thrombolysis by ADC mapping prior to treatment. After two hours of thrombolysis using a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in plasma, whole-blood clots were efficiently dissolved in regions with ADC >or= 0.8 x 10(-9) m(2)/s or T(2) >or= 130 ms, whereas dissolution was poor and prolonged in regions with ADC < 0.8 x 10(-9) m(2)/s or T(2) < 130 ms. An analysis based on a comparison between the initial and final ADC and T(2) maps after two hours of thrombolysis showed that the ADC can more accurately detect the different grades of clot retraction than T(2) and predict the regions of a clot that are resistant to thrombolysis. Therefore, the ADC could be used as an efficient prognostic marker for the outcome of thrombolysis. However, in vivo studies are needed to test this idea.","Vidmar, Jernej; Blinc, Ales; Sersa, Igor","{'Year': '2010', 'Month': 'Jan'}"
,European biophysics journal : EBJ,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Discrimination between red blood cell and platelet components of blood clots by MR microscopy.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pulmonary emboli obtained ex vivo, verified by immunohistochemistry, showed that platelet layers display brighter signal intensity than areas containing predominantly red blood cells (RBC) in T1-weighted MRI. These results were surprising since platelets do not contain paramagnetic haemoglobin that would enhance magnetic relaxation. Our assumption was that the fibrin meshwork areas with entrapped RBC retain abundant extracellular space filled with serum, whereas platelets regroup into tight aggregates lacking serum, essentially mimicking solid tissue structure, rich with cellular proteins that enhance T1-relaxation. Our hypothesis was examined by MRI and NMR relaxometry of in vitro RBC suspensions and sedimented platelets, as well as by MRI of model clots and pulmonary emboli obtained ex vivo. Pure sedimented platelets exhibited shorter proton spin lattice relaxation times (T1 = 874 +/- 310 ms) than those of venous blood of a healthy male with 40% haematocrit (T1 = 1277 +/- 66 ms). T1-values of RBC samples containing high haematocrit (> or = 80%) resembled T1 of platelet samples. In T1-weighted spin-echo MRI echo time and repetition time (TE/TR = 10/120 ms) the ratio of signal intensities between a non-retracted whole blood clot (with a haematocrit of 35%) and a pure platelet clot was 3.0, and the ratio between a retracted whole blood clot with an estimated haematocrit of about 58% and a pure platelet clot was 2.6. We conclude that T1-weighted MRI can discriminate between platelet layers of thrombi and RBC-rich areas of thrombi that are not compacted to a haematocrit level of > or = 80%.","Vidmar, Jernej; Sersa, Igor; Kralj, Eduard; Tratar, Gregor; Blinc, Ales","{'Year': '2008', 'Month': 'Sep'}"

,Dynamic medicine : DM,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Variations in muscle activation levels during traditional latissimus dorsi weight training exercises: An experimental study.,"BACKGROUND: Exercise beliefs abound regarding variations in strength training techniques on muscle activation levels yet little research has validated these ideas. The purpose of the study is to determine muscle activation level, expressed as a percent of a normalization contraction, of the latissimus dorsi, biceps brachii and middle trapezius/rhomboids muscle groups during a series of different exercise tasks. METHODS: The average muscle activity during four tasks; wide grip pulldown, reverse grip pull down [RGP], seated row with retracted scapula, and seated rows with non-retracted scapulae was quantified during two 10 second isometric portions of the four exercises. A repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test was used to determine the influence of exercise type on muscle activity for each muscle. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: No exercise type influenced biceps brachii activity. The highest latissimus dorsi to biceps ratio of activation occurred during the wide grip pulldown and the seated row. Highest levels of myoelectric activity in the middle trapezius/rhomboid muscle group occurred during the seated row. Actively retracting the scapula did not influence middle trapezius/rhomboid activity. CONCLUSION: Variations in latissimus dorsi exercises are capable of producing small changes in the myoelectric activity of the primary movers.","Lehman, Gregory J; Buchan, Day Deans; Lundy, Angela; Myers, Nicole; Nalborczyk, Andrea","{'Year': '2004', 'Month': 'Jun', 'Day': '30'}"
,Thrombosis and haemostasis,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Turbulent axially directed flow of plasma containing rt-PA promotes thrombolysis of non-occlusive whole blood clots in vitro.,"The rate of thrombolysis markedly decreases after a thrombosed vessel is partly recanalized and the remaining clot poses serious risk for rethrombosis. We studied in vitro how thrombolysis depends on penetration of plasma containing thrombolytic agents - 0.2 micro g/ml rt-PA or 250 IU/ml streptokinase (SK) - and the magnetic resonance contrast agent Gd-DTPA (at 1 mmol/l) into non-occlusive clots under conditions of fast (turbulent) or slow (laminar) axially directed flow. Cylindrical non-retracted (fresh) or retracted (aged) whole blood clots were pierced lengthways and connected to a perfusion system. Dynamical spin-echo MRI was used for measuring the penetration of labeled plasma into clots and for assessing the remaining clot size. In both types of clots fast flow enhanced the penetration of Gd-DTPA-labeled plasma into clots in comparison to slow flow. In non-retracted clots, lysis with rt-PA and to a lesser extent also lysis with SK followed the path of plasma penetration into clots. After 40 minutes of fast axially directed flow rt-PA resulted in almost complete lysis and SK left only about a third of the clot undissolved, whereas with slow flow lysis was much slower (undissolved clot: 86 +/- 5 % with rt-PA and 95 +/- 1 % with SK). In retracted clots, substantial lysis was possible only with rt-PA and rapid flow (53 +/- 28% of the clot undissolved after 60 min), whereas the use of SK or slow flow precluded meaningful lysis. We conclude that rapid (turbulent) axially directed flow of plasma along non-occlusive blood clots causes forceful exchange of serum inside the clot with outer plasma which enhances both fibrin-specific and non-fibrin-specific lysis of fresh clots. Dissolution of non-occlusive retracted (aged) clots occurs only under fibrin-specific conditions combined with adequate transport of rt-PA into clots.","Tratar, Gregor; Blinc, Ales; Strukelj, Mitja; Mikac, Ursa; Sersa, Igor","{'Year': '2004', 'Month': 'Mar'}"
,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Biochemical and biophysical conditions for blood clot lysis.,"We have studied how pharmacological dissolution of blood clots was affected by clot retraction, the mode of transport of fibrinolytic agents into the clot and the thickness of the composite fibrin fibers. Retracted clots were resistant to fibrinolysis in a milieu without dissolved plasminogen, because the amount of fibrin-bound plasminogen in retracted clots was insufficient for successful clot lysis. In plasma containing plasminogen, retracted clots were successfully lysed with fibrin-specific plasminogen activators, but not with non-fibrin-specific activators. Preincubation of retracted clots in plasma increased their plasminogen content as well as their sensitivity to fibrinolysis. The rate of lysis was increased up to 100-times when plasminogen activator and plasminogen were introduced into cylindrical clots by pressure-induced bulk flow in comparison with diffusion alone. The magnitude of the increase was similar in retracted and nonretracted clots, but the absolute rate of lysis was faster in non-retracted clots. The influence of fibrin fiber thickness on fibrinolysis was studied by atomic force microscopy. The time to complete lateral section of fibers did not differ between thick and thin composite fibers, and the rate of diameter reduction was faster in thick fibers than in thin ones. Taken together our results suggest that lysis of retracted clots proceeds in circular stages: (a) activation of bound plasminogen followed by partial degradation of fibrin, (b) opening of new plasminogen-binding sites on partly degraded fibrin, (c) binding of plasminogen to the new binding sites which enhances the susceptibility of clots to lysis. Lysis is accelerated by bulk flow of plasminogen activator and plasminogen into clots in comparison to diffusion alone. Fibrinolysis of thick composite fibrin fibers proceeds more efficiently than lysis of thin fibers.","Sabovic, M; Blinc, A",{'Year': '2000'}
,Cell motility and the cytoskeleton,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Trace formation during locomotion of L929 mouse fibroblasts continuously recorded by interference reflection microscopy (IRM).,"The recently reported formation of highly ordered traces by migrating cells has been studied on L929 fibroblasts in time lapse experiments by means of interference reflection microscopy (IRM) as well as by conventional microscopy. Formation of pronounced traces on glass substrates correlates to migration after cell division, and the trace arrangement on the substrate depends on migration velocity: slow migration results in a highly branched, broad, and relatively short trace, while fast migration yields a slim and long trace with few branches. IRM-irradiation caused cessation of locomotion and trace formation and accelerated degradation of existing traces. Traces consist of cord-like cytoplasmic strands, which contain F-actin filaments and they seem to be enveloped by a membrane. It is supposed that cell traces are homologous to filopodia. Traces arise mainly from non-retracted filopodia at the rear margin of the migrating cell. The branches within the traces are the result of the repeated stretching out of a backwardly directed lamellipodium. They arise from the formation of new filopodia that emerge at the actin ribs of the lamellipodium.","Richter, E; Hitzler, H; Zimmermann, H; Hagedorn, R; Fuhr, G","{'Year': '2000', 'Month': 'Sep'}"
,Journal of cell science,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Ca2+-dependent myosin II activation is required for uropod retraction during neutrophil migration.,"Buffering of intracellular Ca2+ transients in human neutrophils leads to reduced motility due to defective uropod detachment on fibronectin and vitronectin-coated surfaces. Since one potential target of a rise in [Ca2+]i is the activation of myosin II, we characterized the role of myosin II during motility. Treatment of neutrophils with a myosin inhibitor (2,3-butanedione monoxime), or myosin light chain kinase inhibitors (ML-7, ML-9, or KT5926) resulted in impaired uropod retraction and a dose-dependent decrease in chemokinesis following stimulation with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Treatment with ML-9 resulted in a redistribution of F-actin and talin to the non-retracted uropods, mimicking the redistribution observed during [Ca2+]i buffering. Impairment of uropod retraction and redistribution of F-actin and talin by myosin II inhibition was only observed on adhesive substrates such as fibronectin and not on poorly adhesive substrates such as human serum-coated glass. At higher concentrations of ML-9, cell polarization was inhibited and pseudopod extension occurred radially. Using an antibody specific for serine 19-phosphorylated regulatory light chain of myosin II, regions of activated myosin II were found at the leading edge as well as the uropod in motile fMLP-stimulated cells. [Ca2+]i depletion caused a 50% decrease in the level of serine 19-phosphorylated myosin II suggesting that activation of myosin II by intracellular Ca2+ transients may be an essential step in establishing a polarized pseudopod and providing the force required for uropod retraction during PMN motility on adhesive surfaces.","Eddy, R J; Pierini, L M; Matsumura, F; Maxfield, F R","{'Year': '2000', 'Month': 'Apr'}"

,Thrombosis and haemostasis,,Journal Article,Non-Retracted,,Effect of retraction on the lysis of human clots with fibrin specific and non-fibrin specific plasminogen activators.,"The effect of the serum content of human clots on their sensitivity to lysis with plasminogen activators was studied in a system composed of 125I-fibrin labeled clots immersed in buffer or in citrated plasma. The effect was studied with plasma clots before or after mechanical compression and with whole blood clots before or after retraction, using either the fibrin specific plasminogen activators recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or recombinant single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA), and the non-fibrin specific activators recombinant two chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rtcu-PA), or streptokinase (SK). In a buffer milieu, all plasminogen activators had a similar fibrinolytic potency towards serum-rich clots (non-compressed plasma clots or non-retracted blood clots): 50% clot lysis in 4 h required 50 to 85 ng plasminogen activator per ml. Serum-poor clots (compressed plasma clots or retracted blood clots) were resistant to lysis in a buffer milieu but became sensitive to lysis following preincubation in plasma for 48 h. These findings indicate that plasma proteins entrapped in clots contribute significantly to their sensitivity to lysis and suggest that the amount of bound or entrapped plasminogen may be a limiting factor. In a plasma milieu, all plasminogen activators lysed serum-rich plasma or blood clots, albeit at higher concentrations (3 to 40 times higher than in the buffer milieu) and with different efficiencies: 50% clot lysis in 4 h required approximately 600 ng/ml of rtcu-PA but 1,500 to 2,000 ng/ml of rscu-PA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Sabovic, M; Lijnen, H R; Keber, D; Collen, D","{'Year': '1989', 'Month': 'Dec', 'Day': '29'}"
